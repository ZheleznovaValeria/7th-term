# Parcel Sass Boilerplate

Parcel Sass Boilerplate is a template for building
web apps fast based on parcel.

## Quick start

Get it running with two easy steps:

1. Clone the git repo â€” `git clone
   https://github.com/enesaktay/parcel-sass-boilerplate.git`
   
2. Run `yarn install` or `npm install` and parcel will install deliver everything you need. The outcome will be in the /dist folder.

For future development (without installing all the time) run `yarn dev` or `npm dev`.

To deploy to production run `yarn prod` or `npm prod`.
