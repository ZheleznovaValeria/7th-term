To build a statistical model, we require a set of training images. The set should be chosen
so it covers the types of variation we wish the model to represent. For instance, if we are
interested only in faces with neutral expressions, we should include only neutral expressions in
the model. If, however, we wish to be able to synthesize and recognize a range of expressions,
the training set should include images of people smiling, frowning, winking, and so on. The
faces in the training set should be of a resolution at least as high as those in the images we wish
to synthesize or interpret.
Each face must then be annotated with a set of points defining the key facial features. These
points are used to define the correspondences across the training set and represent the shape
of the face in the image. Thus the same number of points should be placed on each image and
with the same set of labels. For instance, the first point might be the center of the left eye,
the second the center of the right eye, and so on. Figure 3.1 shows a set of 68 points used to
annotate frontal faces. The more points used, the more subtle are the variations in shape that
can be represented. Typically, one would place points around the main facial features (eyes,
nose, mouth, eyebrows) together with points around the outline to define the boundary of the
face.
