4 Image Analysis with a 3D Morphable Model
In the analysis by synthesis framework, an algorithm seeks the parameters of the model that render
a face as close to the input image as possible. These parameters explain the image and can
be used for high-level tasks such as identification. This algorithm is called a fitting algorithm.
It is characterized by the following four features.
• Efficient: The computational load allowed for the fitting algorithm is clearly dependent on
the applications. Security applications, for instance, require fast algorithms (i.e., near real
time).
• Robust (against non-Gaussian noise): The assumption of normality of the difference between
the image synthesized by the model and the input image is generally violated owing
to the presence of accessories or artifacts (glasses, hair, specular highlight).
• Accurate: As we have already pointed out, accuracy is crucial for the application that is to
use the fitting results (and generally the level of accuracy required depends thereon).
• Automatic: The fitting should require as little human intervention as possible, optimally
with no initialization.
An algorithm capable of any of the four aforementioned features is difficult to set up. An algorithm
capable of all four features is the holy grail of model-based computer vision. In this
chapter we present two fitting algorithms. The first one, called stochastic newton optimization
(SNO) is accurate but computationally expensive: a fitting takes 4.5 minutes on a 2 GHz Pentium
IV. SNO is detailed elsewhere [7]. The second fitting algorithm is a 3D extension of the
inverse compositional image alignment (ICIA) algorithm introduced by Baker and Matthews
[1]. It is more efficient than SNO, and a fitting requires 30 seconds on the same machine. Our
ICIA algorithm was introduced by Romdhani and Vetter [26].
As initialization, the algorithms require the correspondences between
